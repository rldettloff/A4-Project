              Rome is in the central portion of the Italian peninsula. Rome was
              once the most incredible power in the world as seen through many
              of its beautiful structures and cities. “Rome knew glory as the
              fountainhead of
              <a

                >Christianity</a
              >
              and eventually won back its power and wealth and re-established
              itself as a place of beauty, a source of learning, and a capital
              of the arts.(<a
                href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Rome"

                >https://www.britannica.com/place/Rome</a
              >). Many of the attractions and spots to visit in Rome as based on
              Christian thinking. Take some time to think about what country
              used to rule the world. Through the architecture of the ancient
              city, you can see that things have changed. The once leader of the
              world has now turned into a beautiful display of what once was.

              Rome has a Mediterranean climate with cool winters and warm and
              hot summers. The temperatures can vary with lows of 2°C in January
              to the highs of 30°C in July and August. There is little or no
              rainfall in summer months but this then increases to the average
              of 90mm in November and December.

              All-in-one is a great way to describe it. If you want city life,
              take a trip to Tokyo. If you’re looking to dive deep into Japanese
              culture take a trip to Kyoto. There are so many things to explore
              in Japan. From trying different Sakes to exploring the
              one-of-a-kind anime theme park “Nijigen no Mori,” possibilities
              for entertainment are truly endless. But, be sure to bring an
              umbrella if you travel during typhoon season! (April-November).

              Seasonal is definitely a word to take into consideration when
              visiting japan. Eastern Japan has hot and humid summers and cold
              winters with very heavy snow on the Sea of Japan side and in
              mountainous areas. “Western Japan has very hot and humid summers
              (with temperatures sometimes reaching 35 oC or above) and moderate
              cold winters.

              Leave the flip-flops at home: They're not considered very stylish
              in Japanese culture. Lightweight, breathable fabrics should make
              up the bulk of your suitcase. Be sure to bring shorts and a jacket
              when visiting japan and check the weather before your trip to
              ensure the best vacation possible.

              Culture. Street foods, vendors, and the most amazing beaches you

              the flight, Bali features some of the cheapest hotels and Airbnb
              in the world! Also, need a full meal for 2? That will be no more
              than roughly 5-10 USD! Bali’s incredible beaches are nothing short
              of incredible. Some might even say the best in the whole world.

              Paradise? I think yes. Okay okay, We may have said Bali has some
              of the best beaches in the world. However, Turks and Caicos are
              essentially beaches. Unlike Bali, where culture and food is an
              eccentric part of the trip. most of the tourism around Turks and
              Caicos is the absolutely breathtaking crystal clear water.
              Snorkeling, exploring the bays, and staying at all-inclusive
              resorts are the main focus during a trip here. Just don't forget
              the sunscreen!

              The best time to visit Turks and Caicos is between April through
              June. The rest of the year stays relatively warm, with the average
              high never dipping below 75 degrees Fahrenheit.
